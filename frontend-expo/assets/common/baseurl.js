 * 1. Run the backend on your laptop (e.g. node server.js in the backend folder, port 4000).
 * 2. Find your laptop's IP (Windows: ipconfig → IPv4; same WiFi as your phone).
 * 3. Set BACKEND_HOST below to that IP, e.g. 'http://192.168.1.105:4000'
 * 4. Run: npx expo start → scan QR with Expo Go. Your phone will call this URL.
 *
 * For web/same machine: use 'http://localhost:4000'
 * When backend is deployed to cloud: set BACKEND_HOST to that URL (e.g. https://your-api.railway.app)
