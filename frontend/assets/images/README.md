# Image assets – where to put your images

Replace the sample placeholders with your own images. Keep filenames or update the code to match.

| Use | Save your image here | Current placeholder |
|-----|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Logo** (header) | `assets/images/logo-sample.png` | Replace with your logo → same path: `assets/images/logo-sample.png` (or rename in `Shared/Header.js`) |
| **Carousel slide 1** (home banner) | `assets/images/carousel1-sample.png` | Replace image for carousel slide 1 → location: `assets/images/carousel1-sample.png` |
| **Carousel slide 2** (home banner) | `assets/images/carousel2-sample.png` | Replace image for carousel slide 2 → location: `assets/images/carousel2-sample.png` |
| **Carousel slide 3** (home banner) | `assets/images/carousel3-sample.png` | Replace image for carousel slide 3 → location: `assets/images/carousel3-sample.png` |

**Expo app icon / splash (optional):**  
- App icon: `assets/icon.png`  
- Splash: `assets/splash-icon.png`  
- Adaptive icon (Android): `assets/adaptive-icon.png`  
- Favicon (web): `assets/favicon.png`  

You can generate these from a single image using Expo’s tools or replace them manually.
